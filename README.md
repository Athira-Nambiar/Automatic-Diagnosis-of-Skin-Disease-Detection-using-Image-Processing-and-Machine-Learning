Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL), Melanocytic Nevi (NV) and Melanoma Disease are highly contagious disease showing up symptoms. Diagnosis is very challenging as its lesion pattern may appear quite similar to other skin diseases such as herpangina, aseptic meningitis, and poliomyelitis. Therefore, clinical symptoms are essential besides skin lesion’s pattern and position for precise diagnose of this disease. A combination of Image Processing and Machine Learning detection system can play a significant role in the digital diagnosis of these diseases. Various machine learning and deep learning architectures have been proposed for skin disease diagnosis and classification but their accuracy is not preferred in medical science that’s why this new system has been implemented.
